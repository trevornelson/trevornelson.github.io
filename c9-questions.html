			<h1>The Right Answer Starts With The Right Question</h1>

				One of the reasons that I love programming, and the reason I think I am generally able to learn programming concepts fairly quickly, is my ability to “figure it out”. I love jumping into something and being in way over my head, using that as a foundation to learn. An example of this is the first complete program I wrote, which was a reporting dashboard for the marketing agency I worked for. Getting started, I had no clue how to query APIs or databases, or even the first thing about Visual Basic, the programming language I was supposed to use. Although I was able to complete this project, it took me a lot longer than it needed to. Through this experience, I learned just how important it is to know when and how to ask the right questions.

				The most important step in asking good questions is to do your own due dilligence first. This could mean searching on Stack Overflow or even just making sure that you've thought through the issue thoroughly. Not only will this enable your question to be more detailed and increase the likelihood you'll ask the right question that encourages the right answer, it also shows respect for the person or people taking the time to answer your question. 
			</p>

				Another significant factor in asking the right question is to be as specific as you can, while focusing only on the details that matter.  This makes it easier for people to know if they are able to help you and avoids wasting their time on needless details. If posting a question online, include the specific code in question without including the code for the entire program you're writing. Finally, make sure you proof read your questions before posting them online. Edit any grammar or spelling mistakes- you're asking others to take time out of their day to help you, the least you can do is show them respect by making your question understandable.
