            In general, I feel like I'm pretty good at avoiding or neutralizing conflict. I live by the phrase “walk a mile in their shoes”, and try my best to understand other's point of view or actions. While this means that there isn't too much conflict in my life, I've learned over the past few years that conflict actually plays an important piece in nurturing healthy and strong relationships. If someone's actions are frustrating to me, my default is to focus my energy solely on neutralizing my frustration instead of communicating my frustration with the other person sometimes. While I'm generally able to neutralize any feelings of frustration, sometimes the best course of action is to allow for healthy and empathetic conflict to happen.

            One example of this is at my current job at a marketing agency. In early 2014, our practice had a string of significant, large projects and clients on-boarded which happened to coincide with a few members of our team leaving. I had volunteered to take on some new responsibilities in areas of our practice that I disliked. In the coming months, our practice had shifted to much more heavily focus on these areas. Since I was the only one on the team with experience in these areas, my work week became more and more centered on work I disliked and felt unhappy doing, and 40 hour work weeks quickly turned into stressful 70-80 hour work weeks. I felt frustrated internally for a while, and after a few weeks, was really becoming resentful of the situation. I finally discussed this with my manager, who was really understanding and worked with me to try to shift my time away from these areas. Looking back, I realize I should have communicated my issues much more quickly. This would have calmed my negativity earlier on and let me solve the issues instead of just avoid them.
