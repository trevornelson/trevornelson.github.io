        <h1>Using The Enumerable#map Method</h1>
        <h4>December 14, 2014</h4>

        <section>
          <p>
            One of the most useful Ruby methods I've learned about so far at Dev Boorcamp is the #map method of the enumerable class. This method iterates through an array or hash, running a code block on each element and returning an array or hash of the altered values. A quick demonstration to drive things home is always nice:
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].map {|x| x + 100}
=> [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]
      			</code>
  			</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	 Running the above code in IRB will iterate through each of the array elements and add 100 to each of them. The |x| portion of the line of code is setting x as the code block's variable which, in this case, corresponds to the current element in an array as it's being iterated over. Arrays are pretty easy-peasy with the map method, but- 
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the #map method on a hash is pretty similar to an array, spare 3 key (no pun intended) differences:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The map's code block variable needs a buddy. Each iteration of an array just contained a single object, but each iteration of a hash has 2- one for the key and one for the value. This means the map method code block needs a variable for each. Ruby developers commonly use |k, v|, where “k” is the key and “v” is the value.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The code after the block variables needs to be in those cute little curly brackets or else your code will throw errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            … and I can't remember what #3 was. Oh well, moving forward. Once again, a demonstration is worth a thousand words. Unless the demonstration is already a thousand words, then it's worth like a billion or something.
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
> hash = {“one”=>1, “two”=>2, “three”=>3, “four”=>4, “five”=>5, “six”=>6}
> hash.map{ |k, v| { k => v + 100 } }
=> [{“one”=>101}, {“two”=>102}, {“three”=>103}, {“four”=>104}, {“five”=>105}, {“six”=>106}]
          		</code>
          	</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	Hold the phone. The output looks like it's actually an array? Ah, that's right- that's what key difference #3 was.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Using #map on a hash will output an array version of the hash.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you can hack this array of key/value pairs to be usable, it definitely isn't ideal because it won't behave like a normal hash. I found a really handy-dandy solution to this that requires you to extend the standard Hash class in Ruby. No worries, it's not as scary as it sounds.
      	  </p>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <code>
class Hash
    def hmap(&amp;block)
        Hash[self.map {|k,v|| block.call(k,v) }]
    end
end
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
      	  <p>
            This new method looks like this in practice-								
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <code>
> hash.hmap{ |k,v| [ k => v + 100 ] }
=> {“one”=>101, “two”=>102, “three”=>103, “four”=>104, “five”=>105, “six”=>106} 
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's hot biscuits, right? Special thanks to <a href="http://chrisholtz.com/blog/lets-make-a-ruby-hash-map-method-that-returns-a-hash-instead-of-an-array/">Chris Holtz</a> for the great #hmap method.
