            A lot of our lives are determined by the values that we hold. These values drive our actions, dictate the respect we have for others, and influence how others view and interact with us. From as far back as I can remember, I always valued creativity above pretty much everything else. There's something special about being able to create something new, useful and different. When I was in elementary school, I even had a notebook full of “inventions” that I would bring with me to school with me every day. Whether it was nonsensically boyish, like missiles that shot lasers, or kiddish, like a spoon with a secret chocolate syrup reservoir for making undercover chocolate milk, I loved thinking up new things. As I've grown older, I've gotten a better understanding of the deeper value that drives my interest in creativity, which is uniqueness and challenging the status quo. At my current job at a digital strategy agency, I feel the most successful when I'm able to pitch new, unique strategies for stagnant client accounts. I think that I can leverage this at Dev Bootcamp by challenging myself and my pair to try new things in our challenges and projects. One other way that I can help change my mood when I'm frustrated or struggling is to take a moment to think of a way that I can inject some more creativity in the challenge that I'm having issues with.
