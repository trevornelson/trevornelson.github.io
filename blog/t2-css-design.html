            The week 2 curriculum for Dev Bootcamp has been focused on foundations in HTML and CSS. While I've had quite a bit of previous experience with HTML, I've really relied on hacking my way through a CSS stylesheet with past projects. After this week, I feel much more confident styling HTML with CSS, and am looking forward to applying my new CSS skills on my next project. What makes CSS so important for web development is that it allows you to “beautify” websites at scale, instead of changing the styling for each HTML element separately. Two important CSS concepts that are required for styling websites at scale are ids and classes.
          </p>
          <p>
              Ids and classes are so important for CSS and web development, because it allows web developers to add styling to specific types of elements (classes), as well as specific HTML elements uniquely (ids). Classes and ids are both set by adding them to inside of opening HTML tags:
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
&ltdiv id=”id-name”&gt
	&lth1 class=”class-name”&gtSome Text In HTML&lt/h1&gt
&lt/div&gt
      			</code>
  			</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	In the above example, “id-name” and “class-name” can be set to any strings of text you would like, and are used to identify classes and ids for styling to be applied to from the CSS file. This example's CSS might look like this:      
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
#id-name {
	color: red
}

.class-name {
	background-color: blue
}
          		</code>
          	</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	You'll notice that id selectors in CSS are preceded by a “#”, while a class selector is preceded by a “.”. Any CSS styles between the following brackets will be applied to an HTML element with the given class or id name.
      	  </p>
      	  <p>
			If classes and ids both can be used to add styling to specific elements on a page, how can you decide which you should use? Here's some common guidelines to follow when planning an HTML page's classes and ids.											
          </p>
          <p>
          	<ul>
          		<li><b>Use a class</b> for styling that will apply to multiple elements on a page. Ids should only appear on a given HTML page once, while classes can be attached to as many HTML elements as the web developer wants.</li>
          		<li><b>Use an id</b> to add styling to a unique element on the stage.</li>
          		<li><b>Use an id</b> if you want to be able to add an internal link to a specific piece of content, or if it would be valuable for your site's users to link to a specific spot on a page. This can often be really helpful for evergreen content where there is a large amount of content on a page that is split into sections.</li>
          		<li><b>Use an id</b> for layout items such as a page's header, navigation, main content, and footer.</li>
          		<li><b>Use both ids and classes</b> in the same HTML element when necessary. The class will allow a single CSS change to apply to multiple elements, while any specific styles for a given element can be set using the id.</li>
          	</ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          	Properly setting up an HTML document with ids and classes initially can be a huge help when applying  styling to the page and help keep your CSS code efficient and readable.
