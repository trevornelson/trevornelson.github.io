        <h1>Dev Bootcamp &amp; Learning How To Learn</h1>

          	Besides learning web app development at Dev Bootcamp, one of the other focuses of the curriculum is for students to understand how they learn best, and to develop this as a skill. As part of this component of Dev Bootcamp, we learned about Gregorc thinking styles, a theory developed by Anthony Gregorc which seeks to classify people into one of 4 thinking styles. After taking a Gregorc thinking styles quiz, I found that I am primarily an “abstract sequential” thinker. This thinking style is biased towards enjoying when their point is heard in a learning environment, as well as enjoying analyzing situations thoroughly before making a decision. Because I'm an abstract sequential thinker, I also learn best when I have access to experts and am learning in stimulating environments.

			My experience so far in Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp has strongly aligned with what I've learned about my thinking style. I've learned a lot during each of my guided pairing sessions and have really enjoyed them, most likely because I had access to an expert during the sessions. I was able to dive deeper into the material and ask more theoretical questions, learning more about the “why” instead of just the “how” for specific learning concepts. I plan to take full advantage of this by asking questions more during my guided pairing sessions that will help me understand concepts at a deeper, more abstract level.

			My learning style has also become apparent during Phase 0 in my struggle with managing my time. Because I really enjoy learning in a very detailed manner, I have often devoted too much time to challenges that I already understood sufficiently. I'm also very used to less structured learning with less specific rules, due to learning to program on my own for the past year. Learning through structured curriculum is important for me, because it is forcing me to learn in new ways and learn concepts I'm not completely interested in initially. Due to being too detailed in my learning habits often, I've been attempting to time box myself using the pomodoro technique. I've struggled with respecting my initial time boxing, though I've progressively become better at this. Outside of this, I think that the biggest opportunity to grow my personal learning competencies is to try developing my learning style more towards the abstract random learning style, specifically the focus on relationships in learning.
