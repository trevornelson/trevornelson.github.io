            In the past decade, the tech industry has amassed an astronomical amount of data, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Tech giants like Apple and Google are building more and more shopping mall size data warehouses every year to accommodate the tidal wave of data being collected. A large majority of your actions, whether it's shopping online or taking the train to Brooklyn, is leaving behind a trail of data. While this data has already made a meaningful positive impact in everyday life, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity still hiding in data right in front of the tech industry's nose.

            The problem with this massive amount of data the tech industry is sitting on is that it still doesn't know (or simply doesn't) analyze a large amount of it. What's more, the sheer volume of data can make it difficult to strip away the noise to find meaningful data. Picture an old chapel with multiple choirs, each singing a different hymn. Each choir performs beautifully in their own right, but their voices echoing against one another produces a chaotic hum that is undecipherable. There may be a brief moment where you can hear one song with clarity as the other songs are at rest, or the choirs may briefly unite in a musical chord for a note, only to go back to the chaotic hum. This is similar to where big data is today. Insights can be gained from isolated data like the moments when a single choir was singing. This misses a lot of the most significant insights that can be found from looking at data more broadly. Techniques like predictive modeling allow for the voices of the choirs to to be aligned briefly to make a chord, but a majority of the song will still be that chaotic hum.

          	This big data problem has been caused by the tech industry approaching data with a “data first, meaning later” mentality. If data is not meaningful, all it does is dilute any data practices. While advanced data analytics techniques are making it easier to cut through the noise, more attention needs to be placed on data collection by ensuring data has value.
