          	For this week's Dev Bootcamp culture blog, we were to research Stereotype Threat, a social theory where members of a social group are anxious about fulfilling or confirming negative stereotypes about one's own social group. This anxiety has been shown to reduce performance among those affected by stereotype threat in a number of studies. Although most research on stereotype threat has been focused on race, many other forms of this exist, just as gender, nationality, or profession.

            Being a male of European descent, I'm lucky enough to avoid a lot of the nastiest negative stereotypes held today. The stereotypes that I've been affected by are insignificant by comparison. One such example is the stereotype of being lazy or unproductive because I currently work remotely from home. While this is far from true, I find that it's often an opinion that people have when first learning that I work from home. After learning about stereotype threat, I believe that I have felt this negative stereotype and have often responded by over-working myself in an attempt to compensate for it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I don't anticipate this negative stereotype to continue while I'm attending Dev Bootcamp, since I won't be working from home anymore, I will make sure to be especially vigilant in recognizing and rejecting stereotypes. The most significant way to fight stereotype threat is to encourage self affirming behavior and reduce focus on identifying social groups.
