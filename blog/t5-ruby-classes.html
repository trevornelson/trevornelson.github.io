        <h4>January 4, 2015</h4>

        <section>
          <p>
            This week in Dev Bootcamp, we focused exclusively on Ruby classes. Classes can be thought of as a blueprint for computing objects that a program creates. Objects created from the same class follow a shared “blueprint”, which allows for software to interact and manipulate these objects in a standardized way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say, for example, you were shopping for a new guitar in a music store. It's fairly intuitive to tell the difference between a guitar and a drum set when shopping through the store, but computers need a bit more help when it comes to differentiating between the two. Here's how you would “teach” the computer what a guitar is using Ruby:
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
class ElectricGuitar
  def initialize(brand)
    @stringed_instrument = true
    @strings = 6
    @brand = brand
    @pickup = true
  end
end
      			</code>
  			</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	 The initialize method is a special method for classes that tells the computer about various attributes of the object. Each attribute is assigned just like a standard variable would in Ruby, except that the variable name starts with an “@” symbol. The ElectricGuitar class above is “telling” the computer that electric guitars are stringed instruments with six strings and a pickup. It also allows for the guitar brand to be set for new objects of the ElectricGuitar class by passing in the guitar's brand and setting it to @brand. Lets see what creating a new ElectricGuitar object looks like: 
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
guitar = ElectricGuitar.new(“Gibson”)
          		</code>
          	</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	This creates a new instance of ElectricGuitar and sets it to the variable name “guitar”. Now, anytime Ruby sees the “guitar” object, it knows that it's a stringed instrument with a pickup and 6 strings that was made by Gibson. Now, if your computer were walking through the music store shopping for a new guitar, it would be able to identify products in the store as electric guitars. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can't really shop for guitars without trying them out, but it would be pretty inefficient if you had to re-learn how to play a guitar with each guitar you tested out at the music store. Since your  computer now knows what an electric guitar is, it can easily perform the same actions on any of the electric guitars at the store. This is done by setting instance methods when defining a class, which looks like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <code>
class ElectricGuitar
  def initialize(brand)
    @stringed_instrument = true
    @strings = 6
    @brand = brand
    @pickup = true
  end
  
  def play_ironman
    <block of code>
  end

  def play_free_bird
    <block of code>
  end

  def shred
    <block of code>
  end
end
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
      	  <p>
            This means that any instance of ElectricGuitar would be able to use the play_ironman, play_free_bird and shred methods. Here's how that would look using the “guitar” object from earlier:							
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <code>
guitar.play_ironman
guitar.play_free_bird
guitar.shred
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's all well and good, but what if your computer happens to be a metal-head and is shopping for a sweet-ass 7 string guitar? The computer currently thinks that to be an electric guitar, it needs to have the standard 6 strings. You can fix that by creating a sub-class of ElectricGuitar:
          </p>
          <p>
            <pre>
              <code>
class SevenStringGuitar &lt; ElectricGuitar
  attr_reader :strings
  attr_reader :brand

  def initialize(brand)
    @strings = 7
  end
end

blackjackatx = SevenStringGuitar.new(“Schecter”)

blackjackatx.strings
=> 7
blackjackatx.brand
=> Schecter
blackjackatx.shred
=> play some rad solo
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          Adding the “&lt; ElectricGuitar” lets Ruby know that objects from the SevenStringGuitar class are just like ElectricGuitar objects- they're stringed instruments with a pickup. Though, the SevenStringGuitar class overwrites the @string variable to 7. Now, as your computer is shopping for a new guitar it will be able to know that 7 string guitars are just like electric guitars, they just have an extra string.
