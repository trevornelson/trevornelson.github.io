            Dev Bootcamp always stood out to me because of the culture and approach to learning that the program seemed to be centered around. After my first week of Phase 0 at DBC, I've definitely felt great about my decision to attend. From what I've experienced so far, Dev Bootcamp is culturally very similar to what I expected. All of the other members of my cohort seem to be very smart, driven, and open to help others. Phase 0 has certainly been more structured and involved than I was expecting. I was assuming Phase 0 would be more akin to long term homework that was more self-paced, though it became quickly apparent that my learning progress would be pushed even before I started the on-site portion of Dev Bootcamp. I've realized that I need to be much more structured and intentional with Phase 0's curriculum in order to be able to keep up and make the most of this time before the on-site intensive begins. While there's definitely a part of me that's nervous about the fast-paced learning that's to come with Dev Bootcamp, I'm really excited to get started on week 2!
