            One of the main reasons I decided to do Dev Bootcamp, instead of just continuing to learn programming on my own, was to force myself to learn some of the aspects of coding that aren't as glamorous or necessarily “fun”. Learning on my own, I would always focus my time on learning how to make cool new stuff, but neglected learning some of the less-sexy development concepts like version control or testing methodologies. Now that Phase 0 is nearly complete and I've had more exposure to automated testing, I definitely understanding the value of TDD.

            TDD may sound like some kind of virus that spreads through college dorm rooms, but the term stands for Test Driven Development. The essence of TDD is for software to be developed through very short, specific development cycles that are focused on passing a set of automated tests that prove the software is doing what it's supposed to do. Test Driven Development is an iterative process consisting of three steps. The first step in TDD is to write code that tests the functionality or improvement that you or another programmer will be developing. Why start out with setting up your test before you start coding? It not only enables you to think through what you'll be doing to ensure that it's actually testable, it also makes a programmer pause to think through the goals of what they will coding in a detailed, tangible way. After writing the test, the next step is to write the minimum amount of code to pass the test. This helps produce more efficient, less bloated code. The  last step in Test Driven Development is to take the minimal code that passed the unit tests and refactor them for readability and to follow best practices.
