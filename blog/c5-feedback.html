            One of the most important aspects of Dev Bootcamp is its focus on peer programming. As I've solely coded alone up until this point, the thought of pair programming had me somewhat anxious initially. The most significant struggle I continue to have with pairing is feeling pressure to respond immediately instead of being able to take a moment to think through the problem at hand. I can have much more developed ideas and solutions when I have some time to think on my own.

          	Into the second half of Phase 0, while I feel like I can still improve greatly in my pair programming skills, I definitely see the value in pairing. Programming with a pair has helped me catch mistakes or save me from going down a rabbit hole for a challenge through my pair suggesting a new route. Pairing has also helped me think through my code more thoroughly and solidify what I'm learning by requiring me to talk about different techniques I'm employing.

            The feedback component to pairing has been tremendously helpful in helping me develop both my programming and pairing skills. I think that the most impactful aspect of pairing feedback is having a log of ways that I can improve. Every week, I re-read the feedback I've received in order to focus my work in the next week on developing these areas. As programming feedback is concerned, one of the more common piece of feedback is that I can be better with sublime and command line shortcuts. In order to develop this, I've been practicing with ShortcutFoo. I also have had issues occasionally in pairing sessions communicating my ideas and explaining my thought process. As the curriculum has gotten into more complex Ruby concepts, I have definitely felt that explaining my thought process has become more challenging. Writing feedback has generally been fairly natural, though sometimes it has been difficult to find actional feedback to give. In order to develop this and give better feedback, I have been making a conscious effort to keep feedback in mind throughout the pairing session, instead of just thinking about it after the pairing session is over.
