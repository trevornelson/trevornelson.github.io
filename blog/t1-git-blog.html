            After a rushed start getting my enrollment finalized and accidentally bricking, then eventually fixing, my computer's wifi trying to dual boot Linux, my first week of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 is coming to a close today. So what've I learned so far? Can I program leftove.rs, Silicon Alley's hot new app (it's like airbnb but for food)? Did I write some sweet-ass code that allows anyone to download puppies from the internet for free? Sadly, there's no downloadable puppies yet- this week at DBC was devoted to learning the command line and version control. You're probably thinking “command line and version control don't sound like the sexiest of subjects”. Valid point. Also, incorrect. Here's what I've found makes git and bash both totally sexy from an education standpoint.

              First things first- the command line is totally awesome. At first, I had been apprehensive about ever using the command line. Pointing and clicking around folders and files was A-OK by me, and using the command line always seemed so inefficient. Dev Bootcamp forced me to actually learn it, instead of blindly copying commands from tutorials like I had been doing, and I completely love it now. While I still have a lot of work to do before I can claim to be a command line power user (or even mildly proficient), I understand why trying to program only using the operating system's GUI is downright silly. There's nothing quite like being able to zoom around your computer's directory structure, edit things and run scripts without having to touch that damned mouse. One of the major reasons I think that touch screen computing has become so popular is because of their tactile nature- you poke something; it does something. There's seemingly less of a barrier between you and the computer. Using the command line is one step further than this, where you're totally connected to and in control of all that cool stuff your computer is doing.

              Version control is another topic that probably doesn't get the masses up on their feet. Although saves were a great way to keep playing videogames by “ok-i'll-get-ready-for-bed-at-the-next-save-point”-ing, saving isn't generally all that exciting. What makes version control and git any different? Version control is sexy because of how beneficial it is developing software. From playing with git this week, the obvious benefit to using version control is being able to “roll back” changes to software so that you can undo any whoopsie-poopsies in your code. Git, more specifically, seems like it would be really invaluable when joining a new software project that has already been in development by allowing you to get a rough understanding of where the project has been and where it's going. Git makes this easy by keeping a log of all the changes made to a piece of software. These changes are grouped together into commits, which allows software engineers to track changes in a meaningful, logical way. For example, if fixing a program's bug requires edits to 3 separate files, these separate changes can be grouped into the same commit and labeled in git. This allows a programmer to review and understand the meaningful changes that have been made to software. The thing that really makes version control systems sexy, though, is that they embolden developers to try new things. By making reverting changes so easy, being experimental with your programming is a lot less scary. It seems that version control is a major driver of innovation by allowing programmers to make big changes to software. Finally, version control is important because of the collaborative nature it sends itself to. Without version control, developers would constantly be overwriting eachother's work. That would probably make for a fairly tense work environment. GitHub takes git as it's foundation, and allows users to share their code online, so that others can benefit from your good ideas while also helping improve your software.
