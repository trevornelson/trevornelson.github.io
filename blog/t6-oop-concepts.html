            One of the core tenets of efficient and easy-to-manage software is the DRY, or “don't repeat yourself”, principle. Reusing code where possible makes debugging and updating code much easier than the alternative. Two of the main ways to keep your code nice and DRY is through class inheritance and composition. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Inheritance is the concept of creating a parent-child relationship between two classes. The child class inherits the methods and variables from the parent class, which helps software avoid repeating itself. Here's an example:
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
class Musician
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def play_music(music)
    play(music)
  end
end

class RapMusician &lt; Musician
  def initialize
    @genre = rap
  end

  def rap(lyrics, beat)
    play_music(beat)
    print lyrics
  end

end

jova = RapMusician.new(“Jay-Z”)
      			</code>
  			</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	 The RapMusician class is a subclass of musician and is said to have an is-a relationship to the Musician class. You can think of this in that a rapper is-a musician. The RapMusician class inherits the @name assignment and the play_music method from the Musician class. The issue with inheritance in some instances is that as software is developed and classes are built upon, the child class can become increasingly different than the parent class until they are only loosely similar. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Composition, on the other hand, creates what is called a “has-a” relationship between objects. In practice, this essentially just looks like an object being instantiated inside of another class. An example of this kind of relationship would be a Person object that has-a Car object. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	<pre>
          		<code>
class Person
  def initialize(name, car_model)
    @name = name
    @car = Car.new(car_model)
  end
end

class Car
  def initialize(make)
    @make = make
  end
end
          		</code>
          	</pre>
          </p>
          <p>
          	The key to differentiating whether to use composition or inheritance to keep your code DRY is thinking about the nature of the relationship between the objects.
