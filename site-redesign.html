			<h1>Site Redesign: Flat UI &amp; Bootstrap</h1>
			<p>
				During this week's phase 0 curriculum, we took a bit of a breather  from learning new material and reviewed Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I was also able to revisit my site's design, this time using Twitter Bootstrap, a front-end framework that I've toyed with a bit in the past. Bootstrap makes it easy to test new ideas and deploy MVPs quickly. It also takes a “mobile-first” approach to web design, by prioritizing mobile user experience.  Using a front-end framework like Bootstrap can help you spend less time making the foundation of a site, and more time testing new design elements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using Bootstrap, I completely revamped my site and changed the design to look more modern. I researched some current design trends, and decided that I wanted my site to be much bolder, simpler and cleaner looking by using a flat design. In order to do this redesign, I started by essentially just started at the top of my existing page's design and moved down, focusing on each of the 4 major sections of the page at a time. The other most significant change made to the site was removing the blog section of the site, instead replicating each blog post in separate modals.
